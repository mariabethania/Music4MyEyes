After the application starts you can hover the mouse cursor along the top edge of the window and a menu would appear where you can left click and play the songs that are already loaded in slots 1 to 7. 
Songs from 1 to 6 are part of OsoX's album ESCAPE and the 7th song is from Alfred Music Concert Band's youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIyLgYYgaf2yqb5DnkOxu4Q
They have beautiful arrangements for many songs. 

About the app controls:

- You can right click over any slot and load a song of your preference and play it to visualize it. 

- At the bottom edge you can choose one from 7 diferent themes.

- [Vol] you can increase (left mouse button) or decrease (right mouse button) the volume only for the visualizer while the auditioning volume will still depend on Windows volume control.

- [Norm] is a feature that increases (or decreases) the higher frequencies in order to make them appear in the visualizer and match your preference. However, you should consider that high frequencies are very subttle and always will be lower in amplitude than low frequencies.
Anyway, that depends very much on the kind of music you are playing. 
Both "Norm" and "Vol" will increase or decrease by 10s if clicked on the number and by 1s if clicked on the word.

- Click and drag the visualizer in order to rotate it and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

- Also, UP and DOWN arrows rotates the visualizer vertically up and down. LEFT and RIGHT arrows rotates it horizontally left and right.
Note that the visualizer continues to move even after you release the key, you can stop it by hitting the SPACE bar. However, if you hold the SHIFT key while pressing any of the arrow keys the visualizer will stop right after releasing the SHIFT key. 

- Same thing for the zooming keys "q" zooms out and "w" zooms in, or "Q" and "W".

- "x" or "X" will pan up, and "z" or "Z" will pan down.

- "o" or "O" pan left, and "p" or "P" pan right.

- Any changes you make will be automatically saved (current state of visualizer and all 20 songs). This saved state and songs will load automatically the next time you run the program. 

- If for any reason you'd like to reload the default state and default 7 songs you can always go back to it by pressing SHIFT+D. 
Keep in mind that the last saved state will still load automatically every time you re-start the program. 

- You might also want to save several visualizer states and loaded songs in order to enjoy it later. That's what the [Save..] and [Load..] at the bottom are for. 

- To save left click in [Save..], browse for the folder you want to save your current settings to, and give the file a name with extension .m4me or .txt, Ex: MyRockSongs.m4me or MyRockSongs.txt. 

- To load, left click [Load..], look for your saved file and open it. 

- [Columns = min 3, max 48] and [Rows = min 3, max 10] increase or decrease the amount of peaks shown per row and column. 
44x3 could work pretty much as a regular audio analizer but this program is for entertainment only and shouldn't be consider for professional use by any means.
8x8 seems to be a good start since it covers the lower 8th part of the whole spectrum (the one that actually matters here in a general basis). 
Some songs might show more higher frequencies than others that's why all the tweaking available at your hands. Hope that helps.

- The song playing progress bar at the bottom works better with .wav files than with compressed files as .mp3 when clicking with the mouse to a different playing position. 

Enjoy it!
